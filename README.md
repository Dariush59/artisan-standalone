# artisan-standalone

Allows you to use Artisan outside of a Laravel install.

Why do I want this?
-------------------

It's intended so that when you're building a standalone Laravel package, you still have access to the Artisan commands for generating boilerplate and don't have to generate them in your application, then copy them elsewhere.
